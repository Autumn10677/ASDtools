    "## **Basic DataFrame Format**\n",
    "\n",
    "The default DataFrame produced by __ASDtools__ has 14 columns...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Element`: The element symbol and ionization for a given row.\n",
    "2. `Observed (nm)`: The vacuum wavelength this line has been observed at.\n",
    "3. `Ritz (nm)`: The Ritz wavelength inferred from the energy levels of the transition.\n",
    "4. `Transition Type`: Indicates the type of transition rules necessary for the transition (i.e., E1, E2, M1, etc.).\n",
    "5. `Rel.`: The qualitative relative intensity of lines.\n",
    "6. `Ei (eV)`: Energy of the lower level (in eV).\n",
    "7. `Ek (eV)`: Energy of the upper level (in eV).\n",
    "8. `Aki`: Emission transition probability\n",
    "9. `gi`: Lower level statistical weight.\n",
    "10. `gk`: Upper level statistical weight.\n",
    "11. `S`: Line strength (electric dipole matrix element squared).\n",
    "12. `Acc.`: 'Accuracy' of the given transition strength (see NIST help doc).\n",
    "13. `Lower level`: Electronic configuration, term symbol, and J-value of the lower level.\n",
    "14. `Upper level`: Electronic configuration, term symbol, and J-value of the upper level.\n",
    "\n",
    "To arrive at the final DataFrame of __ASDtools__, several columns have to be filtered / processed. For several columns, this only requires the column to be converted into the appropriate data type. But, several columns feature <u>_flags_</u>, where are any non-numeric character that communicate information about the line in question. Although __ASDtools__ has been extensively tested, there is still a possibility that the numerical values in this DataFrame are extracted incorrectly. So, using ``keep_original_columns = True`` you can manually check its accuracy by choosing to keep a copy of each column before any processing was applied."
